# Pirate_Task
Task 1. "I became a new pirate!"
The old captain needs to replenish the team, but only the worthy will get on the ship! He selected ten people. Those who shout the word "Caramba" will get on board.

What should be done
The user enters ten words. Write a program that determines how many of them match the word "Caramba".

What is assessed
The task is considered successful if:

the output result matches the condition;
input contains a valid input prompt;
the program ignores the case of the first letter K;
variables have meaningful names, not just a, b, c, d (video 2.3).
